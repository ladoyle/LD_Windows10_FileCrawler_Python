# LD_Windows10_FileCrawler_Python
A simple python script that searches all directories recursively placing picture, video, text, pdf, and spreadsheet files into clearly marked folders.


Script starts by creating folders in a specified directory for pics/vids, text/docx, pdf, and spreadsheets. It then recursively traverses the filesystem from a given start point looking for these file types, and moves them into the correct folders.
